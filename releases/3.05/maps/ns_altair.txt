------And Finally----------------------------------------------------

Thanks to the NS Dev team for making this great mod that has kept me from doing as much homework as I should.

Thanks to the NS Playtester team for helping me with good feedback and taking time to disuss with me the changes and updates to help make the map that much better.

Thanks Plaguebearer for taking my mediocre layout and turning it into something awsome. Without his help you wouldn't be playing this map.

Thanks to TyrNemesis^ for helping me walk around the map and pointing out balance issues and node placement issues and generally helping to make Altair even better. Half the reason you are reading this file is because this guy helped make Altair what it is.

------Dedication-----------------------------------------------------
Altair is dedicated to my friends from Wake Christian Academy, Cary Alliance Church, and Grace Community Church who will never realize how much their lives have impacted mine and made me a better person because of it.
